# Machine-learning-Algorithms
All the machine learning algorithms are implemented from scratch

General: Inputs are of the form X_train : n x d and Y_train : 1 x n, where n is number of data points, d is number of dimensions/features. The algorithms can be directly used for multiclass classification without any modification

The following algorithms are implemented
1. K-nearest neighbours
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. Linear regression

others coming soon..
