# Machine-learning-Algorithms
All the basic machine learning algorithms are implemented from scratch. Algorithms are implemented in a object oriented fashion

# General

Inputs are of the form X_train : n x d and Y_train : 1 x n, where n is number of data points, d is number of dimensions/features. 

# ML Algorithms implemented
1. K-nearest neighbours
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. Linear regression

others coming soon..
